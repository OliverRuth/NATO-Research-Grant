# NATO-Research-Grant
A repository of files used in my NATO research project

This project was graciously funded by NATO.

The files used include:
- A leak of files and emails from the Iranian NPPD, obtained from a source in Black Reward
- Satellite imagery from European Space Imaging (EUSI)/Maxar and AirBus
- Leaked files from the Russian central bank
- Excel files, which detail economic data sourced from UN Comtrade

Disclaimer: while I have done the best I can to verify the authenticity of the data, I can make no guarantees that it is 100% accurate, as I am just one person with very limited resources. The outputs of this project are editorially independant of NATO.
